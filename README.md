Developed a chess application using Python for the backend with a Flask framework to connect to a JavaScript/HTML front end
Implemented a recursive algorithm in the backend, leveraging a position evaluation function to make strategic moves against the user
Personally developed code for move validation, position evaluation, making moves, etc. without using imported libraries
